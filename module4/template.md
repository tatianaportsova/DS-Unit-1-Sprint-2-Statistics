# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about? Vegan/vegetarian diet and its effects on health.


What decisions do you face? I'm currently contemplating the possibility of completely removing animal products from my diet, but I’d like to have more information before I do that.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation. I can look into how diets and health statistics differ according to different geographical positions.


2. Trend related to the news. Veganism is definitely on the rise. Some people think that it’s just a trend, others - that it’s here to stay. It’d interesting to see the distribution  of people’s opinions.


3. Who does that? I can check the demographic breakdown of the people who are vegans and those who are not.


4. Answering a question people care about. Does vegan diet really helps to improve health? And to what extent?


5. Valuable to businesses. Does it make sense for agriculture businesses to come up with the alternatives to animal products? What kind of alternatives those should be?


6. What's the most popular? What plant-based alternatives to animal products are the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings. What plant-based brands are the most successful? Which companies are making the most money?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? There is a lot of controversy regarding wherever a plan-based diet is beneficial for health.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about? Consumer Behavior


What do you know about? Since I’m a consumer myself, as anybody else who’s a part of the modern society, I’d like to gain more insights into what might be guiding our behavior when it comes to making purchases.


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation. 
How does the consumer behavior changes based on the geographical location?


2. Trend related to the news.
How trends affect consumer behavior? Is there a way to predict the trends that would increase sales?


3. Who does that? 
e.g. What marketing strategies are more successful will younger people/adults?


4. Answering a question people care about.
With the amount of the commercial ads we see everyday, do we still keep the ability to make the decision about purchasing on our own? Or are we primed to make every purchase we make?


5. Valuable to businesses.
How to use the data on consumer behavior to business’s advantage?


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings. 
What marketing strategies have been most successful in the recent past?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Some of the biggest misconceptions could be that all consumers act the same way, or that they are rational in their purchases and actually aware of the reasons of why they do what they do.
