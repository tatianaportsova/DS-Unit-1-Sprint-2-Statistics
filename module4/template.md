# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about? Vegan/vegetarian diet and its effects on health.


What decisions do you face? I'm currently contemplating the possibility of completely removing animal products from my diet, but I’d like to have more information before I do that.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation. I can look into how diets and health statistics differ according to different geographical positions.


2. Trend related to the news. Veganism is definitely on the rise. Some people think that it’s just a trend, others - that it’s here to stay. It’d interesting to see the distribution  of people’s opinions.


3. Who does that? I can check the demographic breakdown of the people who are vegans and those who are not.


4. Answering a question people care about. Does vegan diet really helps to improve health? And to what extent?


5. Valuable to businesses. Does it make sense for agriculture businesses to come up with the alternatives to animal products? What kind of alternatives those should be?


6. What's the most popular? What plant-based alternatives to animal products are the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings. What plant-based brands are the most successful? Which companies are making the most money?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? There is a lot of controversy regarding wherever a plan-based diet is beneficial for health.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
